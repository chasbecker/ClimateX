# ClimateX
 Associated with GEOG112, College of Marin, S24 term
 
 this class is titled "Meteorology & Climatology"
 Immediately upon beginning the climatology section
 I was struck by the definitional concept of applying
 statistics to atmospheric phenomena.  Ah-ha!  Statistics!
 This is interesting.  So after a couple years away
 from all this, I'm back at analytics.  Oh, joy!
